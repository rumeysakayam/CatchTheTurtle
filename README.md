# Catch The Turtle

Welcome to Catch The Turtle, a simple yet fun game created using Python's Turtle module. 
This project is a part of my learning journey in Python programming, and I'm excited to share it with you!

## How to play?

In this game, your goal is to catch the turtle as it moves around the screen. Simply click on the turtle to score points.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by my desire to learn and explore Python. 
It's a small project, but it has helped me understand basic concepts and have fun along the way.

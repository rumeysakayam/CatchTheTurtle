# Catch The Turtle

Welcome to Catch The Turtle, a simple yet fun game created using Python's Turtle module. 
This project is a part of my learning journey in Python programming, and I'm excited to share it with you!

## How to play?

In this game, your goal is to catch the turtle as it moves around the screen. Simply click on the turtle to score points.

When the timer runs out, the game ends, and a "Game Over" screen is displayed.
